# Green Finance Optimization Platform

## Project Overview
The **Green Finance Optimization Platform** is designed to enhance Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies. This platform focuses on **risk assessment** and **investment prediction management** by integrating machine learning models with financial and ESG-related data. The goal is to support sustainable investment decisions, minimize risks, and maximize returns.

## Model Used

- **FinBERT-ESG**: A transformer-based model fine-tuned for ESG-related text classification. It helps in calculating ESG scores from project reports.
  - **Model Link**: [FinBERT-ESG on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yiyanghkust/finbert-esg)

- **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-IQ3_M**: A transformer-based model utilized for answering specific questions and extracting insights from text data.
  - **Model Path**: [Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-IQ3_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF/blob/main/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-IQ3_M.gguf)

## Project Flow

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Input Sources**:
  - PDF project reports containing financial and ESG data.
  - Extracted textual data from PDF images using OCR.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Converted PDF pages to images using PyMuPDF.
  - Extracted text from images using Tesseract OCR.

### 2. ESG Score Calculation
- **Model**: FinBERT-ESG
- **Process**:
  - The text extracted from project reports is fed into the FinBERT-ESG pipeline.
  - Outputs include the ESG category and its confidence score.

### 3. Question-Answering System
- **Model**: Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-IQ3_M
- **Process**:
  - Questions related to project details (e.g., investment amount, project location) are answered using context from the extracted text.

### 4. ROI Calculation
- **Inputs**:
  - ESG category, ESG score, project type, and risk status.
- **Logic**:
  - Base ROI is determined by project type and ESG category.
  - Adjustments are applied based on risk status and ESG score contribution.

### 5. Machine Learning-Based Prediction
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Process**:
  - Predicts ROI using preprocessed features from project data.
  - Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
